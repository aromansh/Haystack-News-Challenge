# Haystack News challenge

The file `src/index.ts` contains the solution for the following problem:

> Please write a function that takes an array of Random Integers as the input and returns an array where all the Even numbers are at the beginning and all the Odd numbers are at the end. Solve with O(n) efficiency and O(1) memory.
> 
> Assume that the complexity of removing an element from the array is O(N).

## Getting started

```bash
nvm install v19.6 # Any modern node version should be fine
npm install
npm test
```
